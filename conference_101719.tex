\begin{abstract}
What is going to be the next big thing? This is the first question that was given to us when we started this project. We had five claims at the start of this project. The claims stated the following: This section must be rewritten to not include special characters and revised for key terms
To answer these claims, we took 3.9gb of CrunchBase’s company data and analyzed 2016-2020 data with custom code in python, along with other tools. We began by cleaning our data then running the data through our code to look for our claims. However, when we ran our code, the data surprised us. We found that there was a decrease in certain sectors of industry.

\section{questions}Can we add the names of the
companies that we are working with? Can we cite Crunchbase as
our source of information?

\section{Introduction}
To find what has the best chances of being the next big thing, we decided to discover any relationships that can be found in the data and define them into claims. Our work involves taking CrunchBase’s company data between 2016-2020, cleaning the data, and creating data models based on our claims. To start this process, we applied for CrunchBase access and began exporting the information needed for our claims. Once we had the datasets, we organized the information and developed our project milestones into sprints to begin working. For our first claim, we found that there is a positive relationship between the number of new companies in a particular field and the overall growth of that field. Furthermore, in the next claim, we found that there is a relationship between the volume of investments in a field and the growth rate of that field. These claims allowed us to develop a new claim which assigns a relationship between pre-seed investments and the future growth rate of a field. This research led us to look deeper into the connection between the growth of funding rounds in certain verticals of fields and the rate of growth of the vertical. The information found in this claim allows us to create a predictive model based on the growth rate of the funding in a particular market. 

When we started the project, we did not know where the data would take us. But what we found was that there were less startup companies compared to previous years. Between 2016-2020 based on CrunchBase's data we found that there was a decrease in certain sectors while the amount of money being dropped in was like previous years or more in some cases. However, in some cases this is believed to be the result of how CrunchBase updates its data, but we are not too sure at this time. This would be an area we would like to check out in future studies.   

\section{Data Preparation}
The CSV files we were provided contained all recorded information you could find on CrunchBase. Data included in these CSV files range from basic descriptions of companies and their key members to the information regarding their funding and investments. Since much of our calculations rely on funding round information for companies in specific categories, the information that had little relevance to either of these requirements were excluded. Some examples include more specific information regarding area, such as city, address, and \textbf{postal_code}, as well as any contact information provided for these companies.  

In total, there were 18 different CSV files provided to us. Luckily, all the data that we needed in order to complete our tasks could be easily found on just three of them - organizations.csv, \textbf{funding_rounds.csv}, and investments.csv. These files provided the general information for each company, including the categories they are listed in, the funding round information recorded for these companies, and the information breaking down each investment made in a given funding round. In order to accommodate our calculations, however, each file used must include the categories in which these companies are listed – a section of data that only organizations.csv contained. Because of this, mergers between these files were necessary.  

In order to merge these files properly, the column containing the company’s universally unique identifier code (uuid) was used to align the entries. This process not only brought the column containing a company’s categorical information to the funding round and investment data files, it also provided a cross-validation between them, which ensured that each entry contained the information we wanted. This unfortunately did also mean that many entries were lost, as not every company had recorded funding round data or investment data. For comparison, our organizations and funding rounds merge file had just under 400 thousand entries, in spite of our separate, cleaned organization and funding rounds files had 1.28 million and 406 thousand entries, respectively. 

One minor issue that we had realized involving these merges was that, while the organizations file and funding rounds file both had the uuid column that was consistent between them, this was not true for the investments file. The file does, indeed, have a uuid column, but as we’ve discovered, it corresponds to the investment record, itself, rather than the company it was for. This issue was, however, easily resolved as the file does include a \textbf{funding_round_uuid} column, which is also found on the funding rounds file. This does mean that a total of two merges must be done in order to get a company’s categorical data into the same dataset as its individual investment data, and therefore suffers from another layer of data loss.  

\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
